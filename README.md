### Deep learning/Computer Vision/Self-supervised learning/Resource efficient learning.
### [Updated as of August 2022]
### Research Work :
- (December 2021 - Present) : Working on a Research project at the intersection of Medical Image and Deep learning based on Dense Prediction and Classification in Colaboration with NYU CDS and NYU Colton Center of Autoimmunity.
- [DEDL](https://github.com/pranavsinghps1/dedl)  Introduces novel Autoencoder post-processing for image segmentation which improves upon traditional segmentation architecture by 3% at no extra space and inference time. We also introduce data-efficient deep learning methods for medical image classification and segmentation which improves upon previous approaches by 26% and 5%.

- [CASS](https://github.com/pranavsinghps1/CASS) is a novel resource-efficient self-supervised learning approach developed for medical image analysis which is computationally efficient and better performing than state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches.
